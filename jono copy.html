                Summary	:
                Six students who conduct Community Service Program (CSP) in a remote village named Desa Bayu, Nur, Widya, Ayu, Bima, Anton, and Wahyu, never think that the village they choose turns out to be a place that will haunt them. They arrive in the village and meet Mr. Prabu, the village head. He warns them not to cross the prohibited gate which located in the forest near the village. The mysterious place might have something to do with the beautiful dancer who starts to disturb Nur and Widya. One by one, they began to feel the strangeness of the village. Bima begins to change his attitude. Their CSP is a mess. It seems that the invisible inhabitants of the village do not like them. Nur finally discovers that one of them violates a fatal rule in the village. Bima and Ayu do an unacceptable thing based on the social norms. Their souls are then punished by the invisible villagers. They ask for help from Mbah Buyut, a local shaman but it is too late. Ayu is punished to dance in front of every single spirit in that village while Bima must serve the queen named Badarawuhi. During their punishment period that lasts for months, they are still alive but in an unconscious state. Their souls are separated from their bodies. In the end, both of them died.
