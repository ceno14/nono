                Towjatuwa and his wife lived in a village on the bank of River Tami. Towjatuwa’s wife was in her mature pregnancy. It seemed that she would give birth to a baby anytime soon. Not too long after, his wife had the first contraction so Towjatuwa called a lady who always helped laboring women. His wife’s condition was not good. The lady asked Towjatuwa to seek for a black, triangle-shaped, and sharp stone in Tami River. He then went away to searched for the stone but he could not find it. 
                Suddenly, there was a strange sound from behind. He turned around and there was a giant crocodile covered with cassowary’s fetahers. stood in front of him. Towjatuwa was scared at first but the crocodile smile at him and turned out the crocodile was very nice and friendly. The crocodile introduced itself as Watuwe, a sacred crocodile in Tami River. Towjatuwa told Watuwe that he was looking for a stone to help his wife’s labor. Watuwe then promised to help Towjatuwa. Towjatuwa then went home and told his meeting with Watuwe to his wife. 
                That evening, His wife felt stronger contractions and she felt so much pain. Towjatuwe and his wife worried that Watuwe forgot his promise. But, apparently Watuwe showed up on time.  Watuwe then helped Towjatuwa’s wife by flicking cassowary’s feather from his body over Towjatuwa’s wife’s belly. The pain was gone and she delivered the baby successfully. 
                As a sign of gratitude, Towjatuwa and his wife asked Watuwe to name their baby. Watuwe then named the baby Narrowa and gave the baby a blessing that in the future, Narrowa would become the greatest hunter in the island. Watuwe then asked Towjatuwa and his wife a favor. Watuwe told that the number of crocodiles in Tami River was sharply decreasing because of the hunter who looked for crocodile’s skin. Watuwe asked them to teach their son not to hunt crocodile and kept Tami River from crocodile hunter. From that moment on, Towjatuwa and his descendants never hunted crocodile and protected them from hunters.
