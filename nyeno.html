                Once upon a time in a village, lived a happy family. That family had a children named Bawang Putih. Her mother passed away due to her disease and now, Bawang Putih lived with her father only. In that village also, lived a widow with her daughter named Bawang Merah. Then, Bawang Merah’s mother married with Bawang Putih’s father. However, Bawang Putih’s new mom and sister showed their true nature. They always scolded and gave her many hard house chores when their father was trading. Not long after, Bawang Putih’s father passed away. 
                One day, Bawang Putih washed Bawang Merah and her mother’s clothes in a river. Unfortunately, Bawang Merah’s clothes driting. Bawang Putih could not find the clothes. Bawang Putih sat down and cried. Suddenly an old woman asked her. Bawang Putih then told her story to the old woman. The old woman then took out something from her basket and it was Bawang Merah’s blouse. The old woman gave it to her but with one condition. She asked Bawang Putih to help her to take all the pumpkins that she carried in the basket to her house. Bawang Putih agreed to help her. They finally reached the old woman’s house. The old woman then gave the clothes back and also asked Bawang Putih to pick one of the pumpkins as a gratitude. Bawang Putih picked the smallest pumpkin then she went home.
                At home, Bawang Putih got scolded because she came home so late. Bawang Putih then explained everything to Bawang Merah and her mother. They then opened the pumpkin. They shocked when they found a lot of gold within it. But Bawang Merah and her mother scolded Bawang Putih again for not choosing the big pumpkin. They said that the big pumpkin should contain more gold than the small ones.
                 Bawang Merah and her mother decided to follow what Bawang Putih had done. They wash their clothes at a river and let one of their clothes drifted away then Bawang Merah sat and cried. After several hours of crying the old woman came. Same as before, the old woman asked Bawang Merah to carry the basket full of pumpkins but Bawang Merah grumbled along the way and kept on complaining. When they arrived, Bawang Merah dropped the basket and made all the pumpkins rolled all over the ground. Bawang Merah asked her reward then she picked the biggest pumpkin. 
                When they got home, they opened the pumpkin immediately. But it’s not gold, it was filled with some snakes and scorpions. Bawang Merah scared then Bawang Putih helped to throw away the pumpkin. When Bawang Putih took it, it turned to its original form. Bawang Merah regrated all her act and since then, Bawang Merah changed and became a good girl.
