                Once upon a time, lived two princes named Prince Sae Bagus Lana and Prince Cunihin. Prince Sae Bagus had good characters, on the other hand, Prince Cunihin was greedy, selfish, and bad tempered. One day, Prince Cunihin stole their teacherâ€™s book. He was unbeatable now and then got rid off his teacher and cursed Prince Sae Bagus Lana as a crooked old man. 
                Prince Sae Bagus Lana searched his Master for guidance. His teacher advised Prince Sae Bagus to make a large bracelet that humans could pass through. If Prince Cunihin could pass the Bracelet, the magic would be lost and Prince Sae Bagus Lana's magic would return and turned him back. After hearing the advice of the Master, he immediately went to a village to become a bracelet maker. Since then, Prince Sae Bagus Lana had been known as Ki Pande Gelang (bracelet maker).
                One day in the Mangosteen Hills, a very beautiful princess was seen sitting. She was Princess Arum. Her eyes were empty, she looked sad because she did not want to marry Prince Cunihin because he was cruel and evil. Ki Pande was very happy to see his lover. However, he was unable to tell the truth about who he was. 
                Ki Pande asked Princess Arum to work together so they can cancel the wedding. Ki Pande asked Princess Arum to ask Prince Cunihin to make a hole in a big rock as a proposal. Prince Cunihin made the stone then took it to the beach. Ki Pande was already there with his big bracelet and spied on him. When Prince Cunihin left, Ki pande then put the bracelet and fit it to the stone. Princess Arum then asked Prince Cunihin to pass through the hole he made. He then stepped across it and suddenly Prince Cunihin turned into old man and lost his magic. At the same time, Prince Sae Bagus Lana also turned to his original form. Prince Sae Bagus Lana Prince explained everything to Princess Arum. They finally got married and lived a very happy life.
