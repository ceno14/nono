                          Character : Budiman, rini, bondi, ari and darto, wisnu, tari, dino, pak ustad, bapak, pak rt 
                          The story starts with a strange incident that happens in Lembang where several dead bodies were gathered in a bowing position. Budiman, a news journalist who already made his appearance in the first movie, was present at the scene. It was believed that the dead rose from their graves on their own and it was only the beginning of something big and sinister. A few years later, after the incident that struck Rini's family, they decided to move to an apartment building in East Jakarta, near the sea. Strangely, it was the only building standing within the area. Some of the residents in the area are two of Bondi's pals, Ari and Darto; little kids who live on the same floor as Rini, Wisnu; alongside Tari, Dino, and Pak Ustad. Bondi found gravestones being buried nearby the apartment building and just left them there without further thought. The next morning, an awful incident happened in the lift of the building, leaving at least 10 people dead. Wisnu managed to get out of the lift before it fell and Bapak was the only person who survived the fall with a leg injury. The night falls with a heavy downpour, leaving the resident stuck inside the building. As the water kept going up, it made the electricity go out. Bondi wandered around the building with his friends. They knocked on the doors of the residents and found that it was mostly vacant. They got into a room that belongs to Pak RT and broke into a locked room full of documents, pictures of the apartment building each taken once every 39 years with the same date. Ian leading the cult who are chanting several words, calling dead bodies, and Ibu. Unfortunately, Bapak was brutally murdered under Ian's command. When Toni was about to get executed, Budiman was able to stop the ritual and saved Rini, Toni, and Bondi. They escaped the building with an inflatable boat.
