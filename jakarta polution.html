                Jakarta residents found their health to be worsening in the past week after the capital was named the most polluted city in the world. Jakarta has topped Swiss company IQAir's ranking of air pollution in major cities for almost a week since Aug. 7. Jakarta has since June also regularly recorded "unhealthy" levels of PM2.5 pollutants. Many people had been experiencing coughs, flu and fever.
                The president outlined several short-term interventions that include weather engineering to induce rainfall in the area as well as regulations to accelerate the implementation of emission limits. He also encouraged offices to implement hybrid working consisting of work from the office and work from home.
