                The player come to inherit a farm after your grandfather's passing. However, in this game, it has been decided by the residents of Mineral Town that you can only inherit the farm if you restore it to its former glory and fit in with the townsfolk within three years. At the end of the three-year time period, Mayor Thomas will come and view your progress. If the farm's condition is acceptable at the end of the third year, the player will be able to keep playing.
