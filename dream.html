                The song title, “ISTJ,” refers to one of the 16 personality types described by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), which stands for Introverted, Sensing, Thinking, and Judging. This personality type is often described as logical, practical, and reserved, which forms the basis of the song’s narrative. The track’s storyline, combined with its high-energy rhythm and compelling lyrics, provides a captivating listening experience. This hip hop song refers to human personalities in order to explore them. Especially because it is related to human relationship and connections.
