                The Starry Night is an oil on canvas painting by Dutch Post-Impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh. Painted in June 1889, it depicts the view from a window just before sunrise, with the addition of an imaginary village. It's vibrant color scheme, swirly twirling stars, and bold Post-Impressionist style all come together to make it a true masterpiece. Post-Impressionism was a predominantly French art movement that developed roughly between 1886 and 1905. Some of the main features of this art style are vivid colours, thick application of paint, distinctive brushstrokes and real-life subject matter. It is permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City since 1941, acquired through the Lillie P. Bliss Bequest. The Starry Night is one of the most recognized paintings in Western art. It was one of the last paintings he made.
