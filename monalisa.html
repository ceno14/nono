                Mona Lisa also known as La Gioconda or La Joconde is a 16th-century portrait painted in oil by Leonardo da Vinci during the Renaissance in Florence, Italy. Leonardo began painting the Mona Lisa in 1503 or 1504 in Florence, Italy. According to Da Vinci's biographer, Giorgio Vasari, after he had lingered over it four years and left it unfinished. The painting was brought to France by Leonardo in 1516, and it was bought by Francis I of France.
                The Mona Lisa is now owned by the Government of France and is shown at the Mus√©e du Louvre in Paris under the title Portrait of Lisa Gherardini, wife of Francesco del Giocondo. For many years, there were other ideas of who the woman in the painting may be. In 2005, Dr. Armin Schlechter found notes that prove that the portrait is Lisa, the wife of Francesco del Giocondo, a rich silk merchant, who lived in Florence. This is the idea that most people accepted since it had already been written by Giorgio Vasari.
