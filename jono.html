                          Characters : Adi, Saman, Ayu, bu woro, bu ningsih, and karta <br>
                          Adi, Saman, and Ayu live in Jatijajar, a remote Central Java village. Having to help their family in the fields, Adi and Saman are often late for school. As a result, the two of them are often punished by Mrs. Woro, their strict teacher. One day, Adi and Saman swear at her and even hope that the teacher will die. This oath is pronounced simultaneously as the Maghrib call to prayer. Not long after, Mrs. Woro dies tragically. Since then, Adi and Saman are experiencing a terrifying supernatural terror. There is a mysterious spirit in a teacher's uniform, just like the one Mrs. Woro wore when she died. Saman’s older brother always beats Saman. One day, Saman wishes death upon his brother, and soon the supernatural presence takes him down.  Saman kills his brother and slaughters the village head's pet chicken. Miss Ningsih is the replacement teacher for Miss Woro and a recent recruit in the local school. Adi arrives late the next day at school, but the new teacher is patient with him. Miss Ningsih proposes to talk with Saman to try to get him to talk, but all goes in vain. Saman commits suicide. Soon, Adi also starts experiencing a supernatural presence around him and possession similar to Saman’s. On the way to the mosque that evening, Ayu spots Adi disfiguring an animal. Miss Ningsih visits Ayu, and her malicious intentions are soon clear to Ayu. She comes to realize that Miss Woro’s ghost has possessed the new teacher. Ayu reaches out for help to Karta, the man who are save from the same incidents 30 years ago. He soon realizes that it is a witch inhabiting the body of Miss Ningsih. They understand that Saman and Adi were both possessed by the djinn, who now wants a fresh body to possess. Karta decides to set fire to the lair that is believed to be the origin of this djinn. As the evil spirit is destroyed in the fire, it leaves Adi’s body once and for all.
